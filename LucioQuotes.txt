Let's up the tempo. 	
Move to the beat. 	
Oh, oh, oh, time to accelerate. 	
Yeeeaah, let's move it people. 	
Yeah, let's party. 	
Speed boost! 
Haha, amp it up. 	
Oh, this is my jam! 	
Oh, turn it up. 	
Pump up the volume. 	
Raisin' the volume! 	
Woo, you feel that? 	
Ooh, you hear that? 	
Sinistro!
Ai sim. 
Vamos esculachar! 
Oh, let's break it down!
Woo, nothing's gonna stop me. 	
Hey, check this out. 	
Aw, man, I'm loving this. 	
Aw, yeah! 
Come on, let's bring it together! 
Ah, I’m in the groove! 	
Ah, look at this team! We're gonna do great. 	
Come on, keep your head up. 	
Enough waiting around, let's get out there. 	
Hey, break time's over. Let's get movin'! 	
I am ready to roll. 	
Just getting started. 	
Let’s get this party started! 
My New Year's resolution? Hm, new skates for all the kids in the neighborhood. 
'Aight. Let's take it from the top. 	
And the beat goes on. 	
I hope nobody saw that. 	
I'm just getting started. 	
Alright, time for an encore. 	
Back in the mix. 
Good as new. 	
Oh man, I feel great! 	
Now that's more like it. 
Having trouble keeping up? 	
Is it hot in here? Or is it just me? 	
Wooh! check this out, I am on fire! 	
Wooh! I am on fire! 
Woo, get hype! 	
Now that's more like it. 	
We're on the same wavelength. 	
Nothin's gonna stop me! 
That's not right! 	
Ugh. 
Thank you, thank you. 	
Unreal! 
I make this look easy! 	
I am runnin' this show! 
Oh, hey hey. 	
Whoa. 
Heads up, they're back for more! 	
Oh. I guess they didn't have enough. 
Lúcio comin' at you. 
Uh-oh, sniper, keep moving. 
Look out, sniper, check your head! 
I'm too young to die. 
Here they come. 
Check it. Enemy turret ahead. 	
Watch out for that turret! 
Little hand here? 	
I'm under attack! 	
I could use some help! 
Take cover! 
Watch your back. 
Behind you! 
I am unstoppable! 
Boostio! 
Oh there's no stopping me now! 
We got this, just a little longer. 
Come on, let’s press the attack. 	
Don’t give up, we can still win this. 	
Get on the attack or it’s game over. 	
We gotta pick it up, attack! 
Let's get them off our objective. 
Takin' the objective, come on over! 	
Oh man, I'm rockin' this objective! 	
Party on the objective, who's in? 	
I'm on the objective, you comin'? 	
I'm takin' the objective. You know you want some. 
Alright, let’s push the payload. 	
Payload's stuck. Let's get it rolling. 	
Someone get the payload moving again. 	
We need to get the payload movin', pick up the pace! 
I am moving the payload. 	
I’m on the payload and moving out. 	
Moving with the payload. 	
This payload's bumpin'! 
Ain’t no way they’re delivering that payload! Get on it! 	
Everyone, stop the payload. 	
Oh, special delivery on the way. 	
Payload’s moving. Let’s shut this party down. 	
Stop the payload. 
You got the beat down. 	
Nailed it! 	
I could do this with my eyes closed. 	
You lost the beat. 	
When the music hits, you feel no pain. 	
How you like that? 	
Hah! Too good. 	
Right on target. 	
You having trouble keeping up? 	
Is this thing on? 	
That was the drop. 	
That was the sound of science. 	
Ha! Served. 	
That's more like it. 	
Sorry. Had to give you the hook. 	
I'm feeling some good vibrations! 
Tchau. 
Falou. 
Ah, garoto. 
Got you this time. 
That's for my family back home! 
Stay outta Rio. That's my turf. 
Oooh, this is going off. 	
Ha ha! Let's keep it going! 	
I must have this track on repeat! 
Oh hey, you remember that turret? Ha, me neither. 	
Oh man, I hope you didn't work too hard on that. 	
Enemy turret destroyed. 
I got the teleporter. That should slow them down. 	
I hope you didn’t work too hard on that. 	
I just destroyed that teleporter. 
Whoo! Check yourself. 
You've been practicing? 	
That was awesome! 	
Nice one! 	
I'll take more where that came from! 
I need to learn to let go... Next time! 
Hello, hello. 	
Hey. 	
Hello. 	
Hi. 	
Oi.
E aí?
Fala tu. 
Thanks! 	
Thank you. 	
Valeu.
Obrigado. 
I hear you. 	
Okay. 	
Got it. 	
Understood. 
Someone call a doctor! 	
I need healing. 
Group up with me. 	
Let's group up here. 	
Group up. 
My ultimate is charging. 
My ultimate is almost ready. 	
My Sound Barrier is almost ready. 
I am ready to activate the Sound Barrier! 	
My ultimate is ready! 
My ultimate is ready! Let's do this! 
Give yourself to the rhythm. 
Can't stop, won't stop. 	
Check this out. 	
Hit me! 	
I'm not hearing that noise. 	
I'm on top of the world! 	
I could do this all day. 	
Hoo! Jackpot! 	
Oh, yeah! 	
That's how you get tinnitus. 	
Why are you so angry? 	
You gotta believe. 
Be champions. 
Suboptimal. 
Killed it! 
So good it's scary! 
Happy holidays! 
Climbing the charts! 
I make this look good... real good. 
Just how I like it. 
Boop! 
You need to learn to take it easy. 
Turn it up in my headphones. 
Everyone gets their plus one. 	
Have some Lúcio-ohs! 
Can you hear me now? 
Wish I'd practice my Japanese more, Konnichiwa! 
Wonder if I have time to catch a hockey game. 
Wow... I never thought I'd see the world like this! 
Let's not waste time, I have tickets to a show tonight. 
Now this is my kinda city, everyone's free to live as they choose. 
I wish I'd brought my stick and pads. I'm sure I could've found a pick-up game here. 
Lúcio checkin' in the game. 
Oh, thanks for the assist! 
My ratings? 99 pace, 99 dribbling, 99 making this look good!
C'mon! Drop the gloves.
You get five for fighting.
Got my gear, time to find a game. 
This payload's jumping! 
Turn it up in my cans! 
This is the time of year to think about everything we have to be thankful for! 
Let's drop the beat!
